# Array Diff

our goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b, keeping their order.

Note: The arrays are not guaranteed to be sorted.

```go
array_diff({1, 2}, 2, {1}, 1, *z) == {2} (z == 1)
```

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

```go
{1, 2, 2, 2, 3}, 5, {2}, 1, *z) == {1, 3} (z == 2)
```
